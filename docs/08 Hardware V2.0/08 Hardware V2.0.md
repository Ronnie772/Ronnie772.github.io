## Overview
This page describes the potential imrovements that could be made to teh motor subsystem is it were to be redisgned.

<br>
------------------------------------------------
1. Replace LM7805 linear regulator with a switching buck regulator to reduce heat and improve efficiency at higher                 motor/system currents.
  
2. Add more test points and dedicated test pads for 5v, motor supply and H-bridge outputs.

3. Add mounts for components the H-Brige so that they can be easily replaced and the solding process is much easier.
