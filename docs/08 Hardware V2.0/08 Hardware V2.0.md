## Overview
Hardware V2.0 represents the next-generation refinement of the motor subsystem, incorporating improvements identified during prototyping, testing, and integration of the initial design. The goals of this revision are to increase electrical robustness, enhance safety, simplify debugging, and expand subsystem functionality for future development.


<br>

**IMPROVEMENT 1.** <br>
              
* Replace LM7805 linear regulator with a switching buck regulator to reduce heat and improve efficiency at                       higher motor/system currents.
  
  
**IMPROVEMENT 2.** <br>  
              
* Add more test points and dedicated test pads for 5v, motor supply and H-bridge outputs.


**IMPROVEMENT 3.** <br>  
              
* Add mounts for components the H-Brige so that they can be easily replaced and the solding process is much                      easier.
